    	Getting OH management referrals right is a key factor in supporting a return to work after sickness absence. Dr Sue Smith and Anne Harriss give some advice on good practice in the second of a two-part series on OH reports for managers.</p>

<p>Management referrals and case management are integral to the role of most occupational health nurses (OHNs). Employees may be referred to an OH service for an opinion of the effect of work on health or health on work.</p>

<p>In the pre-computer era, responses to management were completed by hand and prepared in triplicate with carbon copies. The form provided limited options with tick boxes and a space for comments.</p>
  
<p>The employee was assessed as:</p>
<ul>
<li>fit;</li>
<li>unfit but likely to return to work by [dd/mm/yy];</li>
<li>permanently unfit and recommended for retirement on grounds of ill health; or</li>
<li>unfit for this work but fit for redeployment to work not involving [enter restrictions]; and/or
comments.</li>
</ul>
