    <p>
    	Several family planning methods pre-date the emergence of modern birth control. Before the advent of condoms and hormone-altering drugs, men and women utilized primitive methods for preventing conception. Although some of these techniques are surprisingly effective, they require diligence and careful planning. Consult your gynecologist, obstetrician, midwife or other health care provider for more information about these traditional contraceptive techniques.

  <h5>Abstinence</h5>
  <p>
  	The most effective method of contraception is complete abstinence from heterosexual intercourse. As a contraceptive technique, abstinence is ultimately 100 percent effective and offers additional protection against sexually transmitted infections. Although couples using this family planning technique may engage in other forms of sexual contact, most find it challenging to abstain from intercourse entirely.
